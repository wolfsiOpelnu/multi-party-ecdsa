If you are looking for a way to upgrade your Galaxy S6 Edge Plus or Note 5 to the latest Android version and enjoy the features of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, then you are in luck. There is a ported S8 Plus ROM that you can install on your device and get the best of both worlds.

A ported ROM is a custom firmware that is based on the official software of another device. In this case, the ported S8 Plus ROM is based on the stock firmware of the Galaxy S8 Plus, but it has been modified to work on the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus and Note 5. This means that you can have the same user interface, apps, features and performance of the S8 Plus on your older device.
 
However, installing a ported ROM is not as simple as downloading an app from the Play Store. You need to have some technical knowledge and follow some steps carefully. You also need to understand that there are some risks involved, such as voiding your warranty, losing your data or bricking your device. Therefore, you should only proceed if you know what you are doing and at your own responsibility.
 
## Requirements
 
Before you start, make sure that you have the following requirements:
 
- A Galaxy S6 Edge Plus or Note 5 with an unlocked bootloader and a custom recovery installed. You can use TWRP or any other compatible recovery.
- A computer with a USB cable and the latest Samsung USB drivers installed.
- A backup of your important data, such as contacts, messages, photos, etc. Installing a ported ROM will wipe your device completely.
- A fully charged battery or at least 50% of battery life.
- The ported S8 Plus ROM zip file and the Gapps zip file. You can download them from [this XDA thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-7-0-noble-nougat-experience-stable-s8-port-for-n920x-g928x.3611173/).

## Steps
 
Once you have everything ready, follow these steps to install the ported S8 Plus ROM on your device:

1. Connect your device to your computer and copy the ROM zip file and the Gapps zip file to your internal storage or SD card.
2. Disconnect your device and turn it off.
3. Boot into recovery mode by pressing and holding Volume Up + Home + Power buttons together until you see the recovery screen.
4. In recovery mode, tap on Wipe and then swipe to perform a factory reset. This will erase all your data and prepare your device for the new ROM.
5. Go back to the main menu and tap on Install. Navigate to the location where you copied the ROM zip file and select it. Swipe to confirm the installation.
6. Once the ROM is installed, go back to the main menu and tap on Install again. Navigate to the location where you copied the Gapps zip file and select it. Swipe to confirm the installation.
7. After both files are installed, go back to the main menu and tap on Reboot and then System. This will reboot your device into the ported S8 Plus ROM.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the ported S8 Plus ROM on your Galaxy S6 Edge Plus or Note 5. Enjoy the new features and performance of the latest Android version on your device.
