After you have downloaded the files, you will need to extract them using a program such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can extract them to any folder you like, but we recommend creating a new folder called "Everquest" for convenience. Once you have extracted the files, you will see a folder called "EQEmu" inside the "Everquest" folder. This is where the game files are located. To install the game, follow these steps:
  
1. Open the "EQEmu" folder and run the file called "eqgame.exe". This will launch the game launcher.
2. On the game launcher, click on "Options" and then on "Advanced Options".
3. On the "Advanced Options" window, click on "Patchme" and then on "OK". This will bypass the official patcher and allow you to connect to EQEmu servers.
4. Close the game launcher and go back to the "EQEmu" folder.
5. Open the file called "eqhost.txt" with a text editor such as Notepad.
6. Replace the text inside the file with this: `[LoginServer]
Host=login.eqemulator.net:5998`
7. Save and close the file.
8. Open the file called "UIErrors.txt" with a text editor such as Notepad.
9. Delete all the text inside the file and save it as an empty file.
10. Copy the folder called "UIFiles" from the "EQEmu" folder and paste it into the "Everquest" folder.
11. Rename the folder from "UIFiles" to "UI".
12. Open the folder called "UI" and find a file called "eqmain.xml".
13. Open this file with a text editor such as Notepad.
14. Find this line: `<!--<IncludeFile filename="eqmainhud.xml"/>-->`
15. Delete this line and save the file.
