Internet Download Manager (IDM) has a smart download logic accelerator that features intelligent dynamic file segmentation and safe multipart downloading technology to accelerate your downloads[^1^]. Unlike other download managers and accelerators, IDM segments downloaded files dynamically during download process and reuses available connections without additional connect and login stages to achieve best acceleration performance[^1^].
  
Internet Download Manager (IDM) also has many other features that make it a versatile and reliable download manager. Some of these features are:
  
- Built-in Scheduler: You can set IDM to connect to the Internet at a set time, download the files you want, disconnect, or shut down your computer when it's done[^1^]. You can also create and schedule multiple download queues for downloading or synchronization[^1^].
- Download Categories: You can organize your downloads automatically using defined download categories[^1^]. You can also add your custom categories for some file types or specific sites[^1^].
- Download Panel: You can download files from your favorite web sites with IDM video download panel that appears on top of the browser window when you play a video[^1^]. You can also select multiple links with your mouse and download them with one click using IDM button[^1^].
- Error Recovery: You can resume broken or interrupted downloads due to lost connections, network problems, computer shutdowns, or unexpected power outages[^1^]. IDM will repair the damaged files and continue the download from where it left off[^1^].
- Zip Preview: You can preview the contents of zip files before downloading them[^1^]. This can save you time and bandwidth if you only need some files from the archive[^1^].
- Virus Protection: You can scan downloaded files for viruses using your antivirus program before opening them[^1^]. This can protect your computer from malicious files that may harm your system[^1^].
- Progressive Downloading: You can set IDM to download files with quotas that are useful for connections that use some kind of fair access policy or FAP like Direcway, Direct PC, Hughes, etc.[^1^]. This way you can control how much data you use for downloading[^1^].
- Download Accelerator: You can use IDM as a standalone download accelerator that can speed up your downloads by using multiple connections to the same server[^1^]. This can be useful if you have a slow or unstable connection[^1^].
